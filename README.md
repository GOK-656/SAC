# PolicyGradients-torch

This repo contains implementations of SAC and DDPG in pytorch. 

Structure:
- train.py is the main file to be run: use --test to load a model, and run the model for evaluation
- Hyperparameters are set by default, and are located in the train.py model
- SAC and DDPG can be interchangably loaded by changing the model imported in train.py

Additional guidelines to be added
